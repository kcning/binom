BINOM
=====

BINOM is a macro that computes binominal coefficient at compile time. This
macro is not meant to be used in practice because of slow speed of recursive
macro.

Nevertheless, it shows the capability of C preprocessor and isn't
it cool? ;)

BINOM is inspired by the following material:
1. [Cloak](https://github.com/pfultz2/Cloak)
2. [C/C++ preprocessor metaprogramming](http://saadahmad.ca/cc-preprocessor-metaprogramming-2/)
